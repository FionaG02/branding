3. Brand Positioning - Audience, difference and competition

Riot games targets a younger audience (teens & young adults).

Riot Games stands out for its player-first approach, with dedicated behavior teams and a focus on building positive, 
community-driven ecosystems. It also expands its game worlds into TV, music, and comics, reaching audiences beyond gaming. 
Additionally, Riot invests heavily in esports, treating it as a true spectator sport and supporting grassroots scenes, 
which strengthens player loyalty and long-term engagement.

Riot Games faces brand competition from major game developers like Blizzard Entertainment, Valve, and Rovio, 
as well as emerging mobile titles like Mobile Legends. (MOBAs, FPS, Major events like Esports World Cup).

4. Brand Visual Identity - Name, Logo, colour palette, typeface, style of layouts, graphic element, photography

Every aspect of the brand identity is infused with references to the various games and gaming worlds.
The brand name reflected their image as young, hard-working people who love to have fun.

Riot Games' brand visual identity revolves around flexibility, player passion, and connection to their games, 
featuring the iconic fist bump logo as a symbol of approval and community.

Color palette: #EC0029, #C50022 (60%), #760014, #9D001B (70%), #050505, #313131, #F0F5F1, #C9CBC8, #FFFFFF

Riot Games uses proprietary custom typefaces, such as Beaufort for League of Legends and Riot Sans (refined over time) for its branding,
incorporating elements like sharper angles and tapering strokes to evoke energy and attitude while prioritizing digital legibility.

Their layout is usually the typography being magnetised to the corners and they use the Riot fist as punctuation mostly when creating posts/posters.
The layouts are designed to be intuitive, offering game updates, developer news, esports, and entertainment without overwhelming users.
A unified design system with shared components keeps branding, UI, and UX consistent across games and platforms,
making transitions seamless for players.
